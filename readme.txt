from tutorial:
    Letâ€™s build a LIVE NEWS APP with Next.js 13 (TypeScript, StepZen, Tailwind, Dark Mode, GraphQL)

    by Sonny Sangha

local start:
    npm run dev

the local version has issues

It was deployed to vercel. The deploy is not working properly.

I cloned another person's build:
    C:/dev/live-news

this build also has issues

nextjs 13 is still in beta and seems buggy

I await the arrival on github of other versions of this project.
What we need is github code that includes a properly working deploy.
